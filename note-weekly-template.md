#### 💭Daily Reflection:

💡3 Things I learned today:
1. I learned about the different phases of the TKH Innovation Fellowship and transitional period between them.
2. I learned more about the inner workings of TKH in terms of the of Innovation Fellowship. Such as the rules and regulations,
expectations, how to obtain and get help with technology, how to communicate with a case manager, we rely on over communication and surveys. Events and resources are posted to enhance our changes in getting into the tech world.
3. I learned about my teachers and their backgrounds and how they are going to run the class and support us. 
I also learned about other staff and their occupation and their backgrounds and how they were going to support us.

👁️Two things I would like to know more about:
1. What assignments would we have for career class?
2. How would we propel ourselves to get a job/internship, how did other past members do it to get an early exit.

✋One thing I'm having trouble understanding:
1. How would the improvement plan/making up classwork work in case of emergencies or life circumstances. Also if you don't get a job/internship what happens next.
