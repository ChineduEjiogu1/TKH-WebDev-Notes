connect4 will be a 2d array that will hold columns and rows values

connect4 is a 6 rows by 7 columns 

I have to predetermine the winning positions in an array 
-- 4 vertical consecutively matching positions - separate functions
-- 4 diagonally consecutively matching positions - separate function
-- 4 horizontally consecutively matching positions - separate function

if someone places a chip/piece it must start from bottom to top

If the user input choices match the predetermined winning positions without the impeding of the computer or user 
the use wins and visa versa

The computer/cpu will be a random generated function
-- reverse for loop
-- takes column and rows
